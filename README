=====================================================================

DBD::mysqlPP is a Pure Perl MySQL dirver for the Perl5 Database
Interface(DBI). This module implements network protool between
server and client of MySQL, thus you don't need external MySQL
client library like libmysqlclient for this module to work.
It means this module enables you to connect to MySQL server from
some operation systems which MySQL is not ported. How nifty!
